/**
* A Thread Pool manages execution of jobs on a number of worker threads.
* For compute-bound tasks, the amount of parallelism in a program is limited by the
* number of physical processors available; however for I/O-bound tasks, it makes sense
* to create more threads than the number of physical processors, in order to more fully
* utilize available processors.
* The thread pool executes incoming jobs in parallel, assigning each job to the first
* available thread out of a fixed pool of worker threads.
* Fluctuations in work-load can be accomodated by creating a few extra worker threads
* during peak loads, while terminating superfluous worker threads during periods of
* low activity, thus minimizing resources.
* In order to prevent falling behind on incoming jobs, the calling thread can be made
* to block scheduling the next job until a worker thread becomes available to handle
* it.
* When the thread pool is deleted, all worker threads are allowed to complete their
* tasks prior to destroying the thread pool.
* The jobs which are passed to the thread pool are derived from FXRunnable.  In order
* to perform some useful function, a subclass of FXRunnable should overload the run()
* function.  Any exceptions thrown by this function are caught in FXWorker, thus the
* worker thread will remain running despite exceptions thrown by the job object.
